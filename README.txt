BenNote is the first Android app I've created. I'm starting small, and building in features as I learn more about Android development.

Initial features I'm shooting for are:

	- Type notes in a text field
	- Persistent state (app re-opens to previous state)
	- Note files saved locally

Future features may include
	- Sync between devices (using...? DropBox, git, something custom, what?)
	- Abililty to have structured text, i.e., headings, lists, and code formatting
	- Collapsible text-blocks, in the mobile wikipedia style (this is the feature that inspired making my own notepad app)
	- Read and Write modes - read mode screen frees up space for easier reference
